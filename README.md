[AccraFloods.com](accrafloods.com) is a website created in June 2015 to crowdsource information on the tragic floods which occurred beginning June the same year.

The portal will help disseminate information on safety tips, missing persons, news items, messages of condolence, and images from flooded neighbourhoods.

**Safety Tips:** These will include images, text, etc. detailing safety procedures during such perilous times.

**Missing persons:** All missing persons can be listed on this part of the website. Name, appropriate description, and an image will be used to submit such information.

**News Items:** All news items from blogs, and other news outlets will be posted here for citizens to keep up with information.

**Pictures:** People can send in pictures from their neighbourhoods, etc. If the pictures are geo-tagged, that's even better.

**Social media:** Currently only Twitter and (partially) Instagram, allow for hashtag streams. As a result, all tweets/posts with the #AccraFloods hashtag will be displayed on the social media stream page.

Finally, this website will help us keep track of our efforts as Ghanaians as it monitors (hopefully not) several foods in the coming years.
